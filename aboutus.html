    	<h3>KILEY LEFF</h3>
    	<p>Kiley had the idea for Outro after two of her friends were drugged in the same month. After talking to more of her friends and hearing their stories, she decided something had to be done. Going out had gotten scary. She was frustrated and confused that there wasnâ€™t a platform for girls, LBGTQ+ community members or people of color to find spaces where they can feel safe AND have fun so she set out to find a solution.</p></div>

    	<h3>SARAH DAVIS</h3>
    	<p>In that dorm room with Kiley when she came up with the idea for Outro was her co-founder, Sarah.  Sarah was in charge from the beginning of making this app come to life.  As a young woman in New York City, she understood the struggles other young women faced, and was eager to come up with a solution as well.</p></div>

    	<h3>ANNA GARBER</h3>
    	<p>Anna was the third to get on board with the idea.  As an active participant in organizing various aspects of the Clinton campaign, Anna's knowledge of this type of industry as well as her business background with a degree from Beloit University, she was the perfect addition to the Outro team.  Anna's location in Boston allows for easy communication between the team and the developers (Raizlabs) and she keeps things running smoothely.</p></div>

    	<h3>JOSH BUNCH</h3>
    	<p>Josh entered the team late, but he has not stopped working hard since he joined.  His father, Ted Bunch, owns and operates a company called "A Call to Men," which educated young, college-aged men on how to treat women with respect - a lesson that many have never been taught.  With this abundance of knowledge, Josh is the perfect addition to this team.</p></div>
