   <p>If you are reading this, you probably have a Twitter account. If not, you need to get one ASAP because this is a very quick and efficient way to get free food delivered straight to your door! Whether it is food accounts like @fooji giving away food randomly or your favorite accounts tweeting food links, Twitter will always have your back.</p>
   <h2>Costco, Harris Teeter,  Trader Joes:</h2>

   <p>SAMPLES! SAMPLES! SAMPLES! A great way to fill yourself up for free is to go to grocery stores like Costco and Harris Teeter. They always have bomb ass fresh samples of fruit, cooked food, and snacks, you can literally make your lunch at one of these stores. Get creative during your lunch break!</p>
   <h2>Farmers' Markets:</h2>

   <p>I once scored a free baguette and some flowers at a farmer’s market in NYC. Never underestimate the power of friendly farmers and their willingness to sell their products to you. Bonus: it’s all locally sourced and organic so you can feel good while eating good!!</p>
   <h2>Points at your favorite food joint:</h2>

   <p>At some point in time, you probably had money. During that time, you probably ordered from your fav food spot over and over because it is just too damn good. Well next time you order from one of your favorite food spots, make sure to sign up for their rewards program. Domino’s definitely will give you a free medium two-topping pizza after a certain amount of points earned.</p>
   <h2>Birthday Discounts:</h2>

   <h2>College Food Pantry</h2>
   <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/r8aIrz2Bq9FaU/giphy.gif" height="50%" width="50%">
   <p>At my college (what’s up The New School!!), they provide a food pantry service to students out there who do not have the money to pay for rent, transportation, books, and food at the same time. They provide your basic every day needs from canned food, non-perishable items, grains, etc. Check with your school to see if they also provide a food pantry service so you won’t have to stress out about where your next meal is coming from.</p>
